I want to list some problems that are small, but I think could lead to more interesting stuff, related to the dialectica constructions in
Thesis: "The Dialectica Categories", TR213 from Cambridge, https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf, 1990.

There is a "project" in ResearchGate https://www.researchgate.net/project/Dialectica-Categories-Applications,
but it is getting unwieldy.

I am trying to understand the connection between polynomials (in CT) and the Dialectica construction.
Martin Hyland has some slides in https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/Research/Slides/venice13.pdf about the relationship between type theory and dialectica.
(my own work is on propositional and recently first-order versions of the dialectica construction)

Dialectica categories exist in two shapes (Dial and GDial--the simplified form that has morphisms like Chu spaces).
They also exist both in subobject form or as maps into a lineale L. These variations should give us at least 4 types.
but I only discussed 2 of them: Dial with subobjects, GDial with a lineale.
Can we check that Dial with a lineale and GDial with subject work too?
