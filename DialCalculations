I want to list some problems that are small, but I think could lead to more interesting stuff, related to the dialectica constructions in my
phd thesis: "The Dialectica Categories", TR213 from Cambridge, https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf, 1990.
(the thesis was submitted in 1988, examined in Jan 1989, corrections accepted in 1990)

There is an attempt at a "project" in ResearchGate https://www.researchgate.net/project/Dialectica-Categories-Applications,
but it is getting unwieldy.

I am trying to understand the connection between polynomials (in Category Theory) and the Dialectica construction.

Martin Hyland has some slides in https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/Research/Slides/venice13.pdf about the relationship between type theory and dialectica.
(my own work has been on propositional and more recently first-order versions of the dialectica construction, 
the connections between polynomials happen for dependent types versions of Dialectica, the doctoral work of Moss 2018 and van Glehn 2016)

Seam Moss gave a very clear talk about it in the second Polynomials workshop:

but there is more t say abut these cnnections, I believe.


Dialectica categories exist in two shapes (Dial and GDial--the simplified form that has morphisms like Chu spaces).
They also exist both in subobject form or as maps into a lineale L. These variations should give us at least 4 types.
but I only discussed 2 of them: Dial with subobjects, GDial with a lineale.

1. Can we check that Dial with a lineale and GDial with subjects work too?

A. Problems related to Lenses/Containers:

Bruno Gavranovic talked about how Lenses and Optics differe operationally

Bruno  on  machine learning and Optics

Bruno also produced a bibliography of what he thinks one should read if interested in lenses:

2. question: Using the definition of lenses in Bruno's talk, it seems we could do a Dialectica Lens category, by adding a relation to Bruno's objects.
Would this be useful? if so, for which applications?

B. Problems with Games:

Jeremie Koenig  gave a talk at ACL2021 which I thought was very insightful

C. Implementations of Dialectica:

Implementations can help us consolidate intuitions and also  help us note where intuitions are a bit "shaky".

There  is an implementation of Dialectica categories, coded in Agda by Harley Eades III, for the purpose of proving
cut-elimination for FILL (Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic). This is in https://github.com/heades/cut-fill-agda.

There is also an old implementation of Chu Spaces Live (in Java) at http://boole.stanford.edu/live/ which Vaughan Pratt mantains

Eric Bond has an implementation of polynomials here https://github.com/bond15/Polynomials-Categorically

It would be nice to have something calculating Dialectica spaces in CatLab, to improve synergy with J. Baez project.
