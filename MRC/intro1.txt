Hi all,

In this project we want to investigate a categorical construction that I like a lot. The Dialectica construction is  the main mathematical basis of the 
picture above, which describes some categories of Petri Nets. 
I have been using the Dialectica construction in many applications of categories to Computer Science over the years. 
Recently many people have started noticing and using several variants of this construction at many different levels of generality for different applications. Many of these tend to be higher-order generalizations of the (simple)  original ideas. Or at least this is how I tend to describe the situation:  probably everyone else thinks that the Dialectica is a variant of their constructions.

 
In particular we want to study some of  these variants of the Dialectica construction related to functional languages and we will try to connect them.
 

We will start with the simple construction and then we will look at some of the new variants. 

1. Jules Hedges wrote a blog post about the tantalizing similarities between some of these constructions in Lenses for Philosophers.  
This is a good place to start getting acquainted with the subject.

2. Now, if you like your category theory pure, not applied, you might like to watch these two videos: 
Dialectica for Friends(  and  Dialectica, the Mathematical Version.

3. If, on the other hand, you like Functional Programming you can look at this introduction to lenses by Simon Peyton-Jones (from 2013). 
but he will not say anything about Dialectica.

4. If you like Concurrency Theory you can watch Glynn Winskel's recent talk at the Topos Institute Colloquium. 
You could also have a look into my github file with an attempt at a roadmap (files readme and DialCalculations). 

But we will treat this page as a living document,  will try to keep improving it, and will add papers and more videos later on.
